# Module 9 Challenge SurfsUp

## Purpose

The owner of an ice cream shop wants to find more temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. We will use Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy to filter the data from the hawaii.sqlite database. We will then need to convert the temperatures into a list, create a DataFrame, and then generate the summary statistics. 

## Results

### Differences between June and December

1. June has a higher max temperature of 85 while December has a max temperature of 83. While the lowest temperature for December was 56 and June had 64. 
2. June has the higher average temperature at 74.94 while December's average is 71.04.
3. Additionally, the standard deviation between the two months wasn't that large either. The largest difference is between the count. However, looking at these summary statistics the temperature is pretty consistent between the two months in Oahu.

## Summary

Overall, the surf and ice cream shop should be able to continue business in June and December without much deviation when looking at only the temperature statistics. As both months are consistent with each other.

Two additional queries we can perform for June and December is:

1. Since it is Hawaii what is the amount of rainfall for those months or average percepitation. Then try to line that up with times of the day people are most likely to surf. 
2. Another would be to look at the number of tourists for those months. As well as looking at the hotels, businesses, and competitors in the area.
